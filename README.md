## **E-commerce Sales Chatbot Project Documentation**

### **1. Project Overview**
This project implements an intelligent chatbot for an e-commerce platform. The chatbot helps users search for products and retrieve relevant details based on their queries. The system is built using a **React.js** frontend and a **Flask** backend with mock product data stored in a Python list.

---

### **2. Architecture and Tools**
#### **2.1. Project Architecture**
- **Frontend (React.js)**:
  - Handles user interactions through a dynamic chat interface.
  - Manages user authentication and session handling.
  - Communicates with the backend via API requests.
- **Backend (Flask)**:
  - Processes user queries using a mock product dataset stored in a Python list.

#### **2.2. Tools and Technologies**
- **Frontend**:
  - React.js: For building the chat interface.
  - React Icons: For interactive icons.
  - CSS: For styling with animations and gradients.
  - JavaScript ES6: For frontend logic and interactions.
- **Backend**:
  - Flask: REST API for handling requests.
  - Flask-CORS: Enables cross-origin requests.
  - Python: Backend scripting.
- **Utilities**:
  - Postman: For API testing.
  - GitHub: Version control.

### **3. Features**
#### **3.1. Frontend**
- **Dynamic Chat UI**:
  - User and bot messages are visually differentiated using React Icons and CSS.
  - Supports real-time chat interactions and maintains conversation history.
- **Responsive Design**:
  - Optimized for both mobile and desktop views.
- **Authentication**:
  - Secure login flow using `js-cookie` for JWT token management.

#### **3.2. Backend**
- **Mock Data**:
  - A Python list stores product details such as:
    - `Product ID`
    - `Name`
    - `Category`
    - `Price`
    - `Stock`
- **API Endpoint**:
  - `/chatbot`: Accepts user queries, processes them against the mock data, and returns relevant results.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Provides appropriate responses for invalid or unmatched queries.

---

### **4. Implementation**
#### **4.1. Backend (Flask)**
1. **Mock Product Data**:
   - A list of dictionaries represents the product inventory. Each dictionary contains:
     - `Product ID`
     - `Name`
     - `Category`
     - `Price`
     - `Stock`

   ```python
   products = [
       {"Product ID": 1, "Name": "Smart Watch", "Category": "Electronics", "Price": "$199", "Stock": 50},
       {"Product ID": 2, "Name": "Novel XYZ", "Category": "Books", "Price": "$15", "Stock": 100},
       {"Product ID": 3, "Name": "Cotton Shirt", "Category": "Textiles", "Price": "$25", "Stock": 75},
       # More products...
   ]
   ```

2. **API Endpoint**:
   - `/chatbot`: Processes user queries and returns relevant product details.

   ```python
   @app.route('/chatbot', methods=['POST'])
   def chatbot():
       data = request.get_json()
       query = data.get('query', '').lower()

       matching_products = [
           product for product in products if query in product["Name"].lower()
       ]

       if matching_products:
           return jsonify({
               "response": "Found products:",
               "products": matching_products
           })

       return jsonify({"response": "No matching products found."})
   ```

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Handles invalid requests (e.g., empty queries) with meaningful error messages.
   - Prevents server crashes using try-except blocks.

---

#### **4.2. Frontend (React.js)**
1. **Login Flow**:
   - Uses `js-cookie` for JWT token storage and session management.
   - Ensures only authenticated users can access the chatbot interface.

2. **Chat UI**:
   - Sends user queries as POST requests to the backend.
   - Displays bot responses dynamically in a styled chat interface.
   - Differentiates messages using React Icons for user and bot avatars.

3. **Dynamic Styling**:
   - Gradient backgrounds, hover effects, and animations enhance user experience.

---

### **5. Results**
#### **Example Query**:
Input:  
`Do you have a smart watch?`

Response:  
```json
{
  "response": "Found products:",
  "products": [
    {
      "Product ID": 1,
      "Name": "Smart Watch",
      "Category": "Electronics",
      "Price": "$199",
      "Stock": 50
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### **6. Challenges and Solutions**
1. **Data Management**:
   - Used Python lists to manage product data efficiently without requiring a database.
2. **Query Matching**:
   - Implemented case-insensitive substring matching for accurate results.
3. **Cross-Origin Requests**:
   - Enabled Flask-CORS to allow communication between the frontend and backend.

---

### **7. Future Enhancements**
1. Migrate to a database (e.g., SQLite or MongoDB) for scalable data management.
2. Use NLP libraries (e.g., spaCy) for more natural query interpretation.
3. Implement advanced product filters and sorting options in the chatbot.

---

### **8. Project Setup**
#### **Backend Setup**:
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install flask flask-cors
   ```
2. Run the Flask server:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

#### **Frontend Setup**:
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### **9. Summary**
This project uses a mock data approach to provide a lightweight and efficient chatbot experience. With its dynamic frontend and robust Flask backend, it serves as a strong foundation for further enhancements in e-commerce platforms.
